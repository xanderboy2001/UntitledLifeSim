I'm not exactly sure where to start, but that's kind of been the theme for this project.

I got the itch to do some game development last night, so I sat down and tried getting Unreal Engine ready to go. I noticed that my SSD was running a little low on space, so I decided it would be a good idea to delete some files. Naturally I ended up deleting the entire editor.
